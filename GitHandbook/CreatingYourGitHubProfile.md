# Creating Your GitHub Profile

GitHub recently released a feature that allows users to create a profile-level `README.md` to display prominently on their GitHub profile. A new GitHub profile feature allows more visual contents than the profile bio.

## How do I create my profile README ?

### Step 1: Create a new repository with the same name as your GitHub username

[Create a new repository](https://github.com/new) and set the repository name as your GitHub username.

Check option <b> Public </b> and <b> Initialize this repository with a README </b>

Create a new repository by clicking the <b>Create repository</b>

### Step 2: Change your README.md
GitHub README profile are written in Markdown and you need to learn [Markdown Syntax](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)

<b> Markdown </b> is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as
bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly,
Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

Commit your README changes and see your new GitHub Profile.

## Example

Here is my [README.md](https://github.com/hoduchieu01/hoduchieu01) / [source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoduchieu01/hoduchieu01/master/README.md). 

I use [GitHub Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) to get dynamically generated GitHub stats. In my README.md, I customize my GitHub Readme Stats and you can use this by copying my source code and change the username in these links.

``` [![Ho Duc Hieu's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=hoduchieu01&count_private=true&show_icons=true&theme=tokyonight)](https://github.com/hoduchieu01) ```

``` [![Your name's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=yourusername&count_private=true&show_icons=true&theme=tokyonight)](https://github.com/yourusername) ```

If you want to customize your GitHub Readme Starts, please feel free to follow this guide [GitHub Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats).
