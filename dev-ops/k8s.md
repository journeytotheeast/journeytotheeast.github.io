# Kubernetes

- Kubernetes is a powerful cluster manager and orchestration system for containers. Kubernetes is an open-source project that can run on many different environments - from laptop to high-availability multi-node clusters; from virtual machine to bare metal
- Kubernetes apps are built on containers - these are lightweight applications bundled with all the necessary dependencies and libraries to run them. This underlying structure makes Kubernetes applications highly available, secure, and quick to deploy.
