# 2 cents of learning SQL

## JOINING tables
- Avoid making assumptions about your data or your analyses. For example, rather than assume that all the value in a column are unique just because some documentation says they should be, check for yourself.

- Always look at example outputs of your queries before you strongly interpret aggregate calculations. Take extra care to do this when your queries require joins.

- When your queries require multiple layers of functions or joins, examine the output of each layer or join first before you combine them all together.

- Adopt a heavy skepticism of all your data & results. If you see something you don't expect, make sure you explore it before interpreting it strongly or incorporating it into other analyses.
