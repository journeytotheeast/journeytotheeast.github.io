# LaTeX - Getting Started with LaTeX

## What is LaTeX ?

LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is available as [free software](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/).

## Get started on using LaTeX

### Getting Started - Installing LaTeX
  
Before you start using LaTeX, you have to make it available on your computer.

[Download and Install LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)

[Download and Install MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download)

[Download and Install Perl](https://www.perl.org/)

In this guide, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as a text editor. Then, you have to open <b> Visual Studio Code </b> -> open <b>Extensions</b> (Ctrl + Shift + X)  -> search <b>LaTeX Workshop</b> -> install <b>LaTeX Workshop</b>

Then, you have to follow the LaTeX syntax and create a LaTeX file (<b>name.tex</b>).

To run LaTeX file, open this file -> open <b>LaTeX Workshop</b> (Ctrl+Alt+X) -> <b>Build LaTeX project </b>.

Then you will get several files including(.aux, .fls, .log, .out, .pdf, ...)
